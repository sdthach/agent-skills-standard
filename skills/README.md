## 🧪 Verify Live Skill Evals

The canonical v2.6.0 catalog is `all-v2.6.0`. Verification is local: it
re-scores the immutable transcripts and does not start model workers or use
paid quota.

```bash
pnpm evals:verify -- --run all-v2.6.0
# Verify every retained run:
pnpm evals:verify -- --all
```

For future `SKILL.md` or eval-contract changes, run the no-cost checks first,
then prepare an incremental plan. Only run workers after reviewing the number
of fresh answers:

```bash
pnpm evals:preflight -- --skills-file <changed-skills-file>
pnpm evals:baseline -- --plan
pnpm evals:baseline
pnpm evals:baseline -- --execute
pnpm evals:report
pnpm evals:verify -- --run <new-run-id>
```

Do not run a full paid catalog evaluation for ordinary skill changes. Use a
full run only when the model, protocol, scorer, or generation environment
changes.

## ✍️ Contribution Guide

To add or update a skill:

1. **Token Efficiency**: `SKILL.md` must be **≤ 100 lines**. This is a strict limit to maximize agent context.
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Move all code samples > 10 lines to `references/REFERENCE.md` or specialized reference files.
3. **Imperative Standards**: Use "Compressed Syntax" (starting with verbs, minimal articles) for 40% higher density.
4. **Format Verification**: Ensure YAML frontmatter triggers are precise and categories are lowercase kebab-case.
5. **Validation Checklist**:
   - [ ] SKILL.md ≤ 100 lines (Ideal: 60-80)
   - [ ] No inline code blocks > 10 lines
   - [ ] No redundant frontmatter context in body
   - [ ] Triggers verified for all supported agents
6. **Priority Matrix**:
   - **P0**: Foundational (Architecture, Types, Security).
   - **P1**: Operational (Performance, Idioms, UI).
   - **P2**: Maintenance (Testing, Tooling, Docs).
