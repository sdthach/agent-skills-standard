# Agent Skills Standard CLI

[![License: Apache-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](../LICENSE)

**Sync 242 AI coding standards to any project in one command.** Works with Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, Windsurf, Trae, Kiro, and Roo.

**Current release:** `v2.5.1` — automated SkillSpector security scanning, pull request evaluation gates, and verified release tags.

```bash
npx agent-skills-standard@latest init   # detect your stack
npx agent-skills-standard@latest sync   # install skills
```

If `ags -V` still shows an old version after reinstalling, check your PATH order. `~/Library/pnpm` must come before `~/Library/pnpm/bin`, then run `hash -r` and verify with `ags -V` again.

## What It Does

The CLI takes engineering standards from the [Agent Skills Standard registry](https://github.com/HoangNguyen0403/agent-skills-standard) and installs them into your AI agent's native format:

```bash
npx agent-skills-standard sync

  - Updated .cursor/skills/    (Cursor)
  - Updated .claude/skills/    (Claude Code)
  - Updated .github/skills/    (Copilot)
  - Generated _INDEX.md for 8 categories.
  - AGENTS.md router index updated.
```

The result: your AI agent reads `AGENTS.md`, follows the router to the right category, and loads only the skills that match what you're editing.

| `init`     | Detects your tech stack (Flutter, React, Go, etc.) and creates a `.skillsrc` config                                                                                                                |
| `sync`     | Fetches skills from the registry, writes to agent folders, generates `_INDEX.md` + `AGENTS.md`                                                                                                     |
| `mcp`      | Manage the optional MCP server integration (status / enable / disable / scope / install / uninstall / snippets) — see [Optional: MCP Runtime Enforcement](#optional-mcp-runtime-enforcement) below |
| `validate` | Checks your custom skills against format and token standards                                                                                                                                       |

## Configuration

The `.skillsrc` file controls everything:

```yaml
registry: https://github.com/HoangNguyen0403/agent-skills-standard
agents: [cursor, copilot, claude]
skills:
  react:
    ref: react-v1.3.1
  golang:
    ref: golang-v1.3.1
    exclude: ['golang-tooling'] # skip skills you don't need
  common:
    ref: common-v2.0.1
    custom_overrides: ['common-tdd'] # protect your local edits
```

---

## What Gets Generated

After `sync`, your project contains:

```bash
project/
  AGENTS.md                           # Router table (~20 lines)
  .cursor/skills/
    golang/_INDEX.md                  # Trigger table for Go skills
    golang/golang-language/SKILL.md   # The actual skill
    golang/golang-testing/SKILL.md
    react/_INDEX.md                   # Trigger table for React skills
    react/react-hooks/SKILL.md
    ...
```

**`AGENTS.md`** maps file extensions to category indexes.
**`_INDEX.md`** has two sections: **File Match** (auto-check against your file) and **Keyword Match** (activates when you mention a concept).
**`SKILL.md`** is the skill itself — loaded on demand, averaging ~500 tokens.

## Optional: MCP Runtime Enforcement

The CLI **distributes** skills as static files. The companion [`agent-skills-standard-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agent-skills-standard-mcp) server **serves** them at runtime as MCP tool calls — closing the gap where sub-agents skip skill loading because they don't inherit `AGENTS.md`.

`init` asks once whether to enable it and at what scope. Default is `project` (recommended). Change later with:

```bash
ags mcp status              # show current state + per-agent install
ags mcp scope project       # project | user | snippets-only | disabled
ags mcp install             # apply changes
ags mcp uninstall --from project   # remove our entry; siblings preserved
```

The CLI **never** modifies user-home files (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`, `~/.gemini/settings.json`, etc.) unless you explicitly choose `scope: user` AND confirm each write. See [`mcp/README.md`](../mcp/README.md) for full details and [`mcp/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../mcp/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the threat model.

## Privacy & Security

- **Text only** — the CLI downloads Markdown and JSON files, never binaries or scripts
- **No telemetry** — zero data collection, no background processes
- **Transparent** — fetches from the [public registry](https://github.com/HoangNguyen0403/agent-skills-standard), nothing hidden
- **Override protection** — `custom_overrides` prevents the CLI from touching your local modifications
- **MCP consent model** — runtime configs in `$HOME` are only ever modified with explicit per-file consent
