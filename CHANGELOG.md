# Changelog

All notable changes to the Programming Languages and Frameworks Agent Skills will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] — qrspi fork

**Fork**: [sdthach/agent-skills-standard](https://github.com/sdthach/agent-skills-standard) — extends upstream with the qrspi delivery flow.

### Added

- **qrspi extension**: an 8-phase delivery flow (`qrspi-1-question` … `qrspi-8-pr`) as portable workflows, four research specialists (progressive disclosure — a lean `SKILL.md` plus the full guide in `references/full-guidance.md`), and a `qrspi` umbrella skill. The phase workflows are adapted from [qrspi](https://github.com/matanshavit/qrspi); the specialist bodies are from [humanlayer](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer).
- **Flag-driven source + update policy** for `sync`: `--local` builds from the on-disk registry with no network; `--update=pin|notify|always` (default `pin` performs no upstream check).
- **Lossless Claude specialist frontmatter**: emit `tools`/`model`/`color` when present on a specialist (also submitted upstream).
- **Dev environment**: `mise.toml` (node, pnpm, python, uv), a `pass`-based `.envrc`, and `renovate.json`; pnpm supply-chain hardening — overrides moved to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` so pnpm 10 applies them (`pnpm audit --prod` is clean), plus `minimumReleaseAge`, `verify-store-integrity`, and `onlyBuiltDependencies`.

### Fixed

- **Workflow description quoting**: `WorkflowTransformer` now strips surrounding quotes from a workflow description, so quoted values no longer emit invalid doubled quotes for the Copilot/Codex targets (also submitted upstream).
- **License declaration**: the `LICENSE` file is Apache-2.0, but the README badge and the `cli`/`mcp` `package.json` files declared MIT. This fork aligns all declarations to **Apache-2.0** to match the actual license (this fork was originally assumed to be MIT).

### Credits

## [cli-v2.6.0] - 2026-07-14

**Category**: Live eval evidence retention and report clarity

### Added

- **Canonical Full-Catalog Evidence**: Retained one verified `all-v2.6.0` artifact with 3,233/3,233 answer arms across 265 skills and 22 categories, with zero compromised evidence records.

### Changed

- **Eval History Retention**: Removed superseded live-eval run folders and reset the eval history index to the single canonical run, retaining only its matching archive report.
- **Selective Remediation Evidence**: Consolidated the verified 38-skill remediation overlay into the canonical catalog; all 38 changed skills pass the strict readiness gate without rerunning unchanged skills.
- **Remediation Queue**: Regenerated the remediation queue from the canonical run so follow-up work is tied to current evidence.
- **Report Navigation**: Refreshed the structural and behavioral reports so users can distinguish token/structure measurements from live with-skill effectiveness results.

### Fixed

- **Queue Classification**: Remediation items now use the current run manifest's compromised-arm metadata instead of stale historical classifications.
- **Full-Catalog Coverage Display**: Structural benchmark reports now identify a full-catalog run as covering all categories instead of incorrectly listing them as untested.
- **Mixed-Generation Composition Verification**: Composite runs preserve per-skill scoring and activation semantics and re-score assembled immutable transcripts, preventing legacy source metadata from producing false verification failures.

## [cli-v2.6.0] / [mcp-v0.6.0] - 2026-07-09

**Category**: Runtime skill quality — correct content, smarter MCP loading, validator hardening

### Added

- **Priority Label Vocabulary**: `PriorityRule` now enforces a canonical `P0 (CRITICAL)` / `P1 (HIGH)` / `P2 (MEDIUM)` / `P3 (LOW)` vocabulary (error once migrated); 15+ drifted variants across ~146 skills normalized via new `scripts/migrate-priority-labels.ts` (`pnpm migrate:priority-labels --dry-run`).
- **`TriggersRule`**: New validator rule — every skill must declare at least one file glob or keyword trigger, or it's unroutable.
- **Description Length Warning**: `FrontmatterRule` now warns above 300 chars (in addition to the existing 1024-char hard error) to keep `_INDEX.md` scannable.
- **Eval Assertion Types**: `evals.json` assertions now support `not_contains`, `regex`, `contains_any`, and `file_reference` in addition to `contains`; `scripts/check-alignment.ts` scores all five (unknown types warn and are excluded, so `contains`-only evals score identically to before).
- **Keyword Collision Report**: New `scripts/check-keyword-collisions.ts` (`pnpm audit:keywords`, warning-only) flags keywords/globs shared by multiple skills within a category.
- **Category Framework Maps**: Added `references/framework-map.md` for `android`, `flutter`, `angular`, `ios`, `react-native`, `spring-boot`, and `laravel` — the MCP `get_category_guide` tool now resolves for all of the registry's largest categories instead of 6/23.
- **Database References**: Added `isolation-levels.md`, `index-strategies.md`, `migration-safety-checklist.md`, and `normalization-tradeoffs.md` for the four database skills that previously had no supporting depth.
- **MCP Relevance Ranking**: `load_skills_for_files`/`load_skills_for_keywords` now order results by match strength (narrow file glob > base-language broad glob > exact keyword > partial keyword > composite) instead of index-scan order.
- **MCP Session Dedup**: Skills already loaded earlier in a session are returned as a one-line stub instead of a full body on repeat calls; both load tools accept `force_reload: true` to bypass it.
- **MCP Skill-Context Telemetry**: `get_session_cost` reports estimated skill-context tokens, dedup savings, and skill-context share of prompt tokens; `audit_session_compliance` flags categories whose files were touched but never actually loaded a skill.

### Changed

- **Keyword Matching**: `load_skills_for_keywords` replaced bidirectional substring matching with exact-or-word-boundary matching (partial matches require 3+ chars) to reduce false-positive loads from short keywords embedded in unrelated words.
- **`ios-swiftui` / `ios-state-management`**: State-selection guidance is now `@Observable`-first (iOS 17+); `@StateObject`/`@ObservedObject` reframed as legacy/back-compat only.
- **`flutter-riverpod-state-management`**: Retargeted from "Riverpod 2.0" to Riverpod 3.x.
- **`flutter-idiomatic-flutter`**: Corrected the `Row`/`Column` `spacing` parameter version claim from Flutter 3.10+ to the accurate 3.27+; dropped a non-standard "Signals" recommendation in favor of BLoC/Riverpod.
- **`react-component-patterns` / `react-state-management`**: Added React 19 primitives (`ref`-as-prop, `use()`, `useActionState`, `useOptimistic`) and Verify sections; demoted HOC/classic render-props to a fallback rather than the default.
- **`react-native-navigation` / `react-native-navigation-v6`**: Resolved a priority/scope conflict — `react-native-navigation` is now explicitly the deep-linking companion to `react-native-navigation-v6`; both now acknowledge Expo Router as the default for new Expo projects (matching `react-native-architecture`); removed a stale `createStackNavigator` trigger keyword.

### Fixed

- **`nestjs-security`**: Replaced a deprecated (`csurf`, archived since 2022) CSRF example with a double-submit-cookie pattern via `csrf-csrf`.
- **Outlier Descriptions**: Trimmed 5 skill descriptions (up to 535 chars) to under 300 chars: `quality-engineering-business-analysis`, `common-learning-log`, `common-store-changelog`, `quality-engineering-zephyr-test-generation`, `common-feedback-reporter`.

## [common-v2.2.2] - 2026-07-04

**Category**: Portable SDLC outcome reporting and requirements-first delivery gates

### Changed

- **Portable Outcome Contract**: Added an adapter-neutral `Outcome Report` shape to SDLC workflows so agents can report feature status, requirement trace, completed evidence, missing evidence, needed decisions, and recommended next workflow without runtime-specific IDs.
- **Requirements-First SDLC Gates**: Strengthened BA/PM/SRS responsibilities so vague feature requests draft BRD-lite first, PM-owned PRDs define `REQ-*`/`AC-*`/RACI before implementation, and technical design maps every behavior to PRD ACs and test lanes.
- **Implementation Guardrail**: Updated implementation guidance to consume requirement IDs and AC IDs, and route back to planning/design/readiness when traceability or proof lanes are missing.

### Added

- **Behavior Pressure Coverage**: Added eval scenarios for vague implementation requests, missing PRD/ACs, blocked verification proof, and offshore BA/PM/RACI delivery planning.

### Versions

- **Common Skills**: `2.2.1` → `2.2.2`

## [python-v1.0.0] - 2026-06-29

**Category**: Python skill pack launch and release-tag enforcement

### Added

- **Python Skill Pack**: Added `python-language`, `python-best-practices`, `python-architecture`, `python-testing`, `python-tooling`, `python-async-runtime`, `python-database`, `python-error-handling`, and `python-security`.
- **Python Reference Maps**: Added framework mapping plus focused references for clean architecture, pytest patterns, tooling gates, async boundaries, and database boundaries.
- **Release Tag Validation**: Added `verify:release-tags` so CI validates category `tag_prefix` + version combinations before release drift lands.

### Changed

- **CLI Framework Detection**: Added Python as a backend framework for `ags init`, including Python project marker detection and backend-common category defaults such as `database`.
- **Bulk Skill Release Tags**: Updated the bulk release script to build tags from `skills/metadata.json` `tag_prefix` values instead of hardcoding `<category>-v<version>`.
- **Documentation**: Updated the README skill inventory and release messaging to include the Python category.

## [cli-v2.5.1] - 2026-06-23

**Category**: Security scanning integration (SkillSpector)

### Added

- **SkillSpector Security Scan**: Built a fully automated CI security scanner workflow using NVIDIA SkillSpector to scan all skills in `skills/` for vulnerability patterns.
- **Security Policy**: Added `docs/SECURITY.md` detailing the scanned categories, severity thresholds, verification tags, and instructions for running the scanner locally.
- **SkillSpector Verified Badge**: Added verification badge to the README.md.

### Changed

- **CI Pipeline Gating**: Implemented an inline JavaScript results evaluator (`actions/github-script`) that evaluates risks, logs a GitHub Step Summary, updates pull request comments, and gates PR builds if the score exceeds the safe threshold (25/100).

### Versions

- **CLI**: `2.5.0` → `2.5.1`
- **Root**: `2.5.0` → `2.5.1`

# [cli-v2.5.0] / [mcp-v0.5.0] - 2026-06-18

**Category**: Trusted Review Hardening, Markdown-First Security Handoff & Skill Pack Expansion

### Added

- **Trust Review Policy**: Added `trust-review-policy.md` as the shared trust-gating reference for PR, ticket, and diff review workflows so untrusted prose is handled consistently across SDLC review surfaces.
- **Database Skill Pack Expansion**: Added `database-migrations`, `database-query-performance`, `database-schema-design`, and `database-transactions` plus a category framework map to improve routing for modeling, rollout, and performance work.
- **Framework Maps**: Added stack-level framework maps for `react`, `nextjs`, `nestjs`, and `golang` so broad planning/review tasks can load category defaults without bloating every `SKILL.md`.

### Changed

- **Review Workflow Hardening**: Updated `code-review`, `review-ticket`, `codebase-review`, `security-test`, and `pentest` to classify trust level, prefer markdown evidence continuity, and require stronger proof before escalating security severity.
- **SDLC Routing Simplification**: Removed the separate `security-architecture-review` stage and now route design-level security gaps through `design-solution` or `implementation-readiness`.
- **Review Surface Separation**: Clarified `code-review` as the lean PR merge-risk path and `review-ticket` as the broader specialist-fanout path with AC, metadata, and architecture context.
- **Security Specialist Guidance**: Updated `specialist-security-reviewer` with trust gating, runtime-hardening checks, and new eval coverage for hostile PR instructions and design-level uncertainty.
- **Artifact Model**: Removed the MCP-owned review artifact layer (`CodebaseReviewArtifact`, `SecurityReviewArtifact`, `ReviewDeliveryArtifact`, replay suites, and validator scaffolding) to keep skills and workflows as the source of truth.

### Versions

- **CLI**: `2.4.15` → `2.5.0`
- **MCP**: `0.4.7` → `0.5.0`
- **Common Skills**: `2.2.0` → `2.2.1`
- **React**: `1.3.5` → `1.3.6`
- **Next.js**: `1.4.4` → `1.4.5`
- **NestJS**: `1.4.4` → `1.4.5`
- **Golang**: `1.3.4` → `1.3.5`
- **Database**: `1.3.4` → `1.3.5`
- **Specialists**: `1.1.2` → `1.1.3`

# [cli-v2.4.6] - 2026-06-11

**Category**: Enterprise SDLC & Managed Delivery Alignment

### Added

- **Slug Alignment Protocol**: Enforced consistent `[slug]` identifiers across `docs/brd/`, `docs/prd/`, and `docs/srs/` to enable automatic context linking and requirement traceability.
- **Implicit Workflow Continuity**: Introduced "Recency Bias" logic allowing agents to intelligently identify the active feature from `git status` or file timestamps.
- **Ambiguity Resolution**: Strict policy requiring agents to halt and request clarification if multiple candidate features are detected.
- **Handoff Accountability**: Added mandatory "Handoff Owner" fields to workflows to represent accountability transitions between BA, PM, and IT departments in offshore models.

### Changed

- **Document Partitioning**: Migrated requirement files from generic `docs/specs/` and `docs/templates/` to partitioned, owner-centric directories:
  - `docs/brd/`: Business Requirements (BA/Stakeholder owned)
  - `docs/prd/`: Product Requirements (PM owned)
  - `docs/srs/`: Software Requirements (IT/Implementation owned)
- **Agent Prompt Synchronization**: Synchronized logic across GitHub Copilot (`.github/prompts/`), Codex (`.codex/skills/`), and Antigravity workflow templates for consistent SDLC behavior.

### Versions

- **Common Skills**: `2.1.1`

# [mcp-v0.4.1] - 2026-06-03

**Category**: MCP Skill loader improvement

### Changed

- **MCP Skill Lookup Compatibility**: `load_skills_for_files` is wrong targeting to metadata.json file not include on sync command to user machine, so it not load the correct skills. Improve to using \_INDEX.MD to routing correct places skills

### Versions

- **Common Skills**: `0.4.0` → `0.4.1`

# [cli-v2.4.6] - 2026-05-25

**Category**: SDLC Requirements Template Hardening

### Changed

- **BRD/PRD/SRS Best-Practice Baseline**: Expanded the shared requirements baseline with BRD, PRD, AI-spec, user-story, use-case, and problem-based SRS references plus repo-specific adoption notes.
- **AI-Readable Requirements Templates**: Strengthened BRD-lite, PRD, and SRS/FRS workflows and templates with SMART objectives, Gherkin-compatible ACs, INVEST checks, use-case scoping, requirement cards, NFR measurement, and trace-to-evidence gates.
- **MCP Skill Lookup Compatibility**: `get_skill(category, name)` now accepts both canonical ids (e.g. `quality-engineering-playwright-cli`) and the prefixless form (`playwright-cli`) to support varied runtime naming conventions without changing the canonical catalog.

### Versions

- **Common Skills**: `2.0.9` → `2.1.0`

# [cli-v2.4.6] - 2026-05-22

**Category**: SDLC Requirements Traceability & Review Tooling

### Added

- **Living BRD/PRD/SRS Baseline**: Introduced a shared public-source baseline for BRD (Why), PRD (What), and SRS/FRS (How) guidance, referenced directly from SDLC workflows to improve trust and auditability.
- **Requirements Standard Skills**: Added `common-business-requirements` (BRD / BRD-lite) and `common-software-requirements` (SRS/FRS) to formalize discovery, IDs, quality gates, and anti-patterns.
- **Canonical Default Workflows**: Added missing canonical `.agents/workflows` sources for `deploy-release`, `traceability-audit`, `session-report`, `publish-notes`, and `retro-learn`, so generated exports are no longer the only source of truth.

### Changed

- **BRD-lite / PRD / SRS/FRS Workflow Clarity**: Updated `brainstorm-feature`, `plan-feature`, `design-solution`, and `implementation-readiness` to explicitly state which requirement layer they cover, how traceability is gated, and when to update living specs.
- **PR Reviewer Consolidation**: Consolidated PR/MR metadata review into `specialist-pr-reviewer` (supports GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps) and removed the separate ADO-only reviewer.
- **SDLC Audit**: Strengthened `audit:sdlc` checks to detect `DEFAULT_WORKFLOWS` vs canonical `.agents/workflows` mismatches and fail when exports exist without canonical sources.

### Versions

- **CLI**: `2.4.5` → `2.4.6`
- **Root**: `2.4.5` → `2.4.6`
- **Common Skills**: `2.0.8` → `2.0.9`

# [cli-v2.4.5] - 2026-05-20

**Category**: Release Readiness & CLI Packaging

### Fixed

- **Stale pnpm Shim Recovery**: Added startup detection for old pnpm shim paths and a guided repair flow so `ags -V` can be corrected after reinstalling the CLI.

### Versions

- **CLI**: `2.4.4` → `2.4.5`
- **Root**: `2.4.4` → `2.4.5`

# [cli-v2.4.4] - 2026-05-20

**Category**: Release Readiness & CLI Packaging

### Fixed

- **pnpm Upgrade Verification**: Improved the upgrade flow to verify the installed pnpm package before treating `ags -V` mismatches as shell PATH issues.

### Versions

- **CLI**: `2.4.3` → `2.4.4`
- **Root**: `2.4.3` → `2.4.4`

# [cli-v2.4.3] - 2026-05-20

**Category**: Release Readiness & CLI Packaging

### Fixed

- **Packaged CLI Version**: Updated the release flow so the built `ags` binary reports the published version after packaging.

### Versions

- **CLI**: `2.4.2` → `2.4.3`
- **Root**: `2.4.2` → `2.4.3`

# [cli-v2.4.2] - 2026-05-19

**Category**: Token Optimization & Redundancy Reduction

### Added

- **Professional Security Testing Workflows**: Added two PTES-aligned red-teaming workflows: `/pentest` (7-phase autonomous assessment) and `/security-test` (continuous DevSecOps pipeline for PRs).
- **Security Audit Skills**: Added `common-pentest-methodology` (PTES alignment, attack taxonomy) and `common-exploit-verification` (mandatory PoC rules, false-positive filtering) to the `common` category.
- **Security Specialist Sub-Agents**: Introduced three new high-density specialists to execute advanced security tasks:
  - `specialist-logic-hacker`: For stateful Business Logic (OWASP WSTG-BUSL) and Auth bypasses.
  - `specialist-mobile-reverser`: For binary analysis, SSL pinning bypass, and IPC attacks on iOS/Android.
  - `specialist-aspm-correlator`: For ingesting raw SAST/SCA outputs and performing impact analysis.
- **Global Token Optimization**: Injected `rtk` (Rust Token Killer) and `/caveman` mode recommendations globally into the generated `AGENTS.md` index template via `IndexGeneratorServiceImpl.ts`.
- **Unit Tests**: Added explicit test case in `IndexGeneratorService.spec.ts` to assert that the generated router table successfully includes the Global Token Optimization block.

### Changed

- **Removed Redundant Directives**: Stripped redundant token optimization blocks from `skills/common/common-context-optimization/SKILL.md`, `skills/common/common-security-audit/SKILL.md`, `skills/specialists/specialist-logic-hacker/SKILL.md`, `skills/common/common-security-audit/references/implementation.md`, and `.agents/workflows/pentest.md` since they are now inherited globally.

### Versions

- **CLI**: `2.4.1` → `2.4.2`
- **Root**: `2.4.1` → `2.4.2`
- **Common Skills**: `2.0.7` → `2.0.8`
- **Specialists**: `1.1.1` → `1.1.2`

# [cli-v2.4.1] - 2026-05-19

**Category**: 🔄 Configuration Self-Healing & Legacy Migration

### Fixed

- **Configuration Backward Compatibility**:
  - **Self-Healing Migration**: Added automated self-healing migration in `ConfigService` to gracefully convert legacy `openai` agent configurations in `.skillsrc` to `codex` (`Agent.Codex`) in memory and update `.skillsrc` on disk.
  - **Schema Preprocessing**: Updated `SkillConfigSchema` with a Zod preprocessor on the `agents` array to ensure robust schema validation across all parsing contexts.

### Versions

- **CLI**: `2.4.0` → `2.4.1`

# [mcp-v0.4.0] - 2026-05-19

**Category**: 🔌 Workflow Discovery & Execution Engine

### Added

- **`agent-skills-standard-mcp`**:
  - **Procedural Discovery Tools**: Added `list_workflows` to list all available standard operating procedures (e.g., `dev-fix`, `plan-feature`) in `.agents/workflows/`.
  - **Procedural Execution Tools**: Added `get_workflow` to retrieve exact step-by-step markdown instructions for any specific workflow.
  - **Authoritative Server Instructions**: Updated `SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS` with explicit guidance commanding agents to invoke `list_workflows()` at the start of any task or session.
  - **Session Telemetry Auditing**: Expanded `SessionTracker` to log `list_workflows` and `get_workflow` events, ensuring compliance audits verify workflow provenance.
  - **Workflow Verification**: Added full unit test coverage in `WorkflowIndex.spec.ts` verifying scanning, frontmatter parsing, and error handling.

### Versions

- **MCP**: `0.3.0` → `0.4.0`

# [cli-v2.4.0] - 2026-05-16

**Category**: 🧭 Agentic-AI Learning Integration, Specialist Expansion & SDLC Hardening

### Added

- **Portable SDLC Artifacts**:
  - Centralized canonical templates (PRD, Architecture, Task, Walkthrough, etc.) into shared workflow references.
- **Session Telemetry & Cost Reporting**:
  - Added `get_session_cost()` tool to the MCP server for tracking tool calls and session metadata.
  - Introduced `common-telemetry` skill to enforce standardized markdown cost reporting.
  - Updated canonical `.agents/workflows/*.md` sources to include a mandatory `## Cost Report` section.
- **SDLC workflow spine**:
  - Added `implementation-readiness` and `review-ticket` as synced workflows.
  - Unified `sdlc`, `dev-fix`, `verify-work`, `verify-bug`, and `code-review` through new readiness and review surfaces.
- **Native specialist pack**:
  - Expanded `specialists` into 13 native sub-agents covering Jira, architecture, codebase scouting, AC verification, test gaps, Zephyr, ADO PR review, Confluence, PR comment batching, integration test generation, TC creation, security, and TDD.
  - Added eval coverage for the specialist pack and synced them to native agent folders.

### Changed

- **CLI version**: `2.3.0` → `2.4.0`.
- **Workflow Spine Consolidation**:
  - Kept and synced `traceability-audit`, `deploy-release`, `publish-notes`, `session-report`, and `retro-learn` as part of the SDLC workflow spine.
  - Updated `sdlc` routing and `docs/sdlc-workflow-quick-reference.md` to reflect the streamlined lifecycle.
- **Audit gates**: Extended `audit:sdlc` to verify new workflows, specialist evals, and generated native agents.
- **Integrity Gates**: All 259 skills now undergo a strict alignment pass (HTML comment stripping) and validation check.
- **Hook Architecture & Runtime Support**:
  - Modernized `HookService` by replacing legacy duplicate Python hook templates with a single canonical universal JavaScript hook (`preedit-skill-loader.js`), complete with automated self-cleaning migration.
  - Added native PreToolUse hook configuration support for `Cursor` (`.cursor/hooks.json`), `Windsurf` (`.windsurf/hooks.json`), and `Gemini` (`.gemini/hooks.json`).
  - Renamed `Agent.OpenAI` to `Agent.Codex` across the CLI codebase, metadata, and documentation to accurately reflect the runtime.
- **Skill Updates**:
  - `common-v2.0.7`: Added `common-telemetry` skill and integrated `Vibe Security Scan` lens into `common-security-audit`.
  - `android-v1.4.2`: Updated `android-compose-migration` with list-heavy screen guidance (`LazyColumn`/`LazyRow`) and `android-concurrency` with `SharedFlow` replay rules.
  - `php-v1.3.6`: Cleaned up formatting and git rules in `php-tooling`.
  - `specialists-v1.1.1`: Added 10 new native specialists (`ac-verifier`, `ado-pr-reviewer`, `architecture-guard`, `codebase-scout`, `confluence-searcher`, `integration-test-generator`, `pr-commenter-batch`, `tc-creator`, `test-gap-finder`, `zephyr-scanner`) and updated `specialist-security-reviewer` and `specialist-tdd-implementer`.

### Notes

- `pnpm check-alignment --threshold 90` still fails on 71 older framework skills; that remains a separate framework quality-wave backlog.

## [cli-v2.4.0] - 2026-06-15

**Category**: CLI Tool

### Maintenance

- chore: bump version to 2.4.0 and update documentation (#95)

## [cli-v2.2.3] - 2026-05-10

**Category**: 🔄 Workflow Sync Optimization & Registry Reliability

### Fixed

- **`WorkflowSyncService`**:
  - **Preserved `workflows: true`**: Fixed a bug where setting `workflows: true` in `.skillsrc` was incorrectly overwritten by a fixed array of defaults. It now remains `true` to ensure automatic discovery of all future registry workflows.
  - **Comprehensive Workflow Discovery**: Updated the CLI to include `dev-fix`, `implement-feature`, and `verify-bug` in the default synchronization list.
  - **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed status logs during the workflow assembly phase, including count of fetched files and warnings for empty registry matches.
- **`SyncService`**:
  - **Local Registry Detection**: Added a proactive warning when running `sync` within the registry repository itself, clarifying that the CLI pulls from the remote GitHub origin rather than local unpushed files.

### Versions

- **CLI**: `2.2.2` → `2.2.3`

## [mcp-v0.2.0] - 2026-05-09

**Category**: 🚀 Transport Modernization & Security Hardening

### Changed

- **`agent-skills-standard-mcp`**:
  - **Migrated to Streamable HTTP**: Replaced the deprecated `SSEServerTransport` with `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`. This aligns the server with the latest MCP specification for more robust and efficient session management.
  - **Enhanced Security**: Switched to `createMcpExpressApp` from the SDK, which provides built-in DNS rebinding protection and localhost security defaults.
  - **Unified Endpoints**: Introduced a standard `/mcp` endpoint while maintaining backward compatibility for legacy `/sse` and `/messages` routes.
  - **Multi-session Reliability**: The server now correctly handles multiple simultaneous SSE connections by leveraging the SDK's built-in session tracking.

### Versions

- **MCP**: `0.1.2` → `0.2.0`

## [cli-v2.2.2] / [mcp-v0.1.2] - 2026-05-09

**Category**: 🤖 Specialist Integration & Reliability Hardening

### Added

- **Integrated Specialist Sync**: `SpecialistSyncService` is now a first-class phase in the core `ags sync` lifecycle. Sub-agent definitions are automatically transformed and deployed to all supported platform folders (`.clauderules`, `.cursor/agents`, etc.) based on the registry whitelist.
- **Sub-Agent Workflow Delegation**:
  - Integrated `@specialist-tdd-implementer` into `implement-feature` and `dev-fix` implementation phases for strict TDD enforcement.
  - Added "Kick-off Implementation" step to `plan-feature.md` to automate the transition from planning to execution.
- **Workflow References**: Added a `### References` section to `verify-bug.md` linking to the `diagnostic-decoder.md` for automated failure analysis.
- **Automated Folder Migration** in CLI: `SyncService` now automatically detects legacy `.agent` (singular) folders and performs a non-destructive merge into the new `.agents` (plural) structure before cleanup.
- **Migration Unit Tests**: 2 new test cases in `SyncService.spec.ts` verifying selective file migration and safe folder removal.

### Changed

- **Workflow Branding**: Renamed all `*-plus.md` workflows (e.g., `dev-fix-plus.md` → `dev-fix.md`) to standard names, unifying the "Plus" enterprise features into the core workflow library.
- **Path Standardization**: Fixed legacy `.agent/workflows` → `.agents/workflows` path references in `common-workflow-writing` and project documentation.

### Fixed

- **Security Hardening**: Updated root `package.json` with `pnpm overrides` to patch critical and moderate vulnerabilities in `hono`, `ip-address`, `fast-uri`, and `path-to-regexp` found in `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `@nestjs/swagger` dependency trees.
- **Override Cleanup**: Removed 10 redundant/stale overrides from `package.json`, improving project hygiene while maintaining zero vulnerabilities.

### Versions

- **CLI**: `2.2.1` → `2.2.2`
- **MCP**: `0.1.1` → `0.1.2`
- **Common**: `2.0.4` → `2.0.5`
- **Quality Engineering**: `1.4.4` → `1.5.0`
- **Dart**: `1.3.4` → `1.3.5`
- **Flutter**: `1.7.0` → `1.7.1`

- **Database**: `1.3.3` → `1.3.4`

## [cli-v2.2.1] / [mcp-v0.1.1] - 2026-04-23

**Category**: Fix — Type Safety & Configuration Paths

### Fixed

- **`agent-skills-standard-mcp`**:
  - Replaced `any` with `z.ZodObject<any>` in the `ToolDef` interface for better type safety in the MCP server registration.
  - Resolved TypeScript instantiation-depth limit (TS2589) by using a registration wrapper with loosened static types.
- **CLI Configuration**:
  - Corrected configuration paths for `Antigravity`, `Kiro`, `Roo`, and `Copilot` runtime integrations.
  - Added user-scope configuration support for `Antigravity`, `Kiro`, `Copilot`, `OpenCode`, and `Codex`.
  - Refined `SyncCommand` to re-prompt for MCP enablement if previously declined, ensuring users aren't locked out of the feature.

## [cli-v2.2.0] / [mcp-v0.1.0] - 2026-04-22

**Category**: Runtime Enforcement Layer — MCP Server + Consent-Respecting CLI Integration

### Added

- **`agent-skills-standard-mcp` package** (new): standalone MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that serves matched `SKILL.md` content to AI agents on demand. Works in any MCP-capable runtime (Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, Kiro, Continue, Gemini CLI). Closes the gap where sub-agents skip skill loading because they don't inherit `AGENTS.md`.
  - 5 tools: `load_skills_for_files`, `load_skills_for_keywords`, `get_skill`, `list_categories`, `audit_session_compliance`.
  - Server-level `instructions` field (1.9 KB workflow guide) per [awesome-mcp-best-practices §2.1](https://github.com/lirantal/awesome-mcp-best-practices).
  - Tier-aware matching honoring `metadata.broad_globs` + `base_language_skills` (same algorithm as `IndexGeneratorService`).
  - **Composite-trigger expansion** honoring `foundational_composite_rules` — surfaces foundational skills (`common-best-practices`, `common-security-standards`, `common-performance-engineering`, `common-api-design`, `common-system-design`, `common-tdd`, `common-accessibility`, `common-error-handling`, `common-observability`, `common-mobile-ux-core`) automatically when an adjacent skill loads. Closes the gap where broad-glob foundational skills were previously invisible to `load_skills_for_files`.
  - Graceful empty-state handling — server starts even when no skills installed; tools return setup guidance instead of crashing.
  - Positive-guidance no-match responses (lists available categories) per awesome-mcp §1.4.
  - Stdio transport (universal across runtimes).
  - 27 unit tests covering matching, tier model, composite expansion (8 cases incl. non-recursion + missing-skill tolerance), empty-state, no-match guidance, audit trail.
  - Full [`mcp/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./mcp/ARCHITECTURE.md) with 7 ADRs covering standalone parser, transport choice, tier model, instructions field, positive-guidance, no-persistence design, and composite-trigger expansion.
- **`ags mcp <action>` subcommand** (new): manage the MCP integration without editing `.skillsrc` by hand. Actions: `status` | `enable` | `disable` | `scope <project|user|snippets-only|disabled>` | `install` | `uninstall` | `snippets`.
- **MCP consent step in `init`**: asks once whether to enable the MCP server and at what scope. Default is `project` (recommended) — never auto-writes to user-home configs without explicit per-file consent.
- **MCP wiring in `sync`** (Phase 7): if enabled, installs the server entry into the configured runtime config files. Project-scope only by default. Generates `./mcp-config-snippets/*.json` for manual paste-in. User-scope writes always prompt per file.
- **`McpConfigService`** (new): pure read-modify-write service that safely merges only the `agent-skills` server key into runtime configs. Other MCP servers in the same file are preserved byte-for-byte. 12 unit tests cover safe-merge, scope semantics, uninstall, snippet generation.
- **`mcp` block in `.skillsrc` schema**: `enabled`, `scope`, `prompted`, optional `version`. Decisions persist so users aren't re-prompted on every sync.
- **`scripts/release-mcp.ts`**: release script for the MCP package mirroring `release-cli.ts` / `release-server.ts` patterns. Includes build + test verification before tagging, and `npm publish` step (skippable with `--skip-publish`).

### Changed

- **CLI version**: `2.1.3` → `2.2.0` (minor bump — new feature, non-breaking).
- **Root README**: added Step 4 documenting the MCP integration, the consent model table, and the `ags mcp` subcommand reference.
- **`cli/README.md`**: added MCP section pointing to the subcommand.

### Privacy / consent guarantees

- The CLI **never reads or modifies** files in `$HOME` unless the user explicitly chooses `scope: user` AND confirms each file write.
- `scope: snippets-only` writes ONLY to `./mcp-config-snippets/`; no runtime configs touched.
- All scope decisions are recorded in `.skillsrc` and changeable via `ags mcp scope <X>`.
- Safe-merge: other MCP servers in the same config file are never replaced or removed.
- `ags mcp uninstall` removes only the `agent-skills` entry, leaves siblings intact.

### Skill content fixes — broad-glob skills with weak keywords

Audit found 6 broad-glob non-foundational skills whose keyword sets were too sparse (4 each) to be reliably discoverable via natural-language `load_skills_for_keywords` calls. Each skill received 7-8 additional intent-style keywords (e.g. `"ios performance"`, `"sql injection"`, `"react typescript"`) so developers can find them by describing the task instead of remembering API names:

- `ios/ios-performance` — added: `ios performance`, `swift performance`, `optimize ios`, `time profiler`, `frame drops`, `main thread`, `slow scroll`
- `ios/ios-security` — added: `ios security`, `swift security`, `keychain`, `biometric`, `face id`, `touch id`, `certificate pinning`, `app transport security`
- `php/php-security` — added: `php security`, `sql injection`, `xss php`, `prepared statement`, `csrf`, `sanitize input`, `password storage`
- `react/react-security` — added: `react security`, `csp`, `content security policy`, `sanitize html`, `secure cookie`, `jwt react`, `oauth react`, `dompurify`
- `react/react-typescript` — added: `react typescript`, `tsx types`, `props interface`, `generic component`, `useState type`, `useRef type`, `typed hooks`
- `swift/swift-best-practices` — added: `swift idiomatic`, `swift naming`, `swift best practice`, `swift conventions`, `value type`, `immutability swift`, `guard let`

### Tooling fix

- `scripts/generate-indices.ts`: changed import from abstract `IndexGeneratorService` to `IndexGeneratorServiceImpl`, fixing a pre-existing `generateAllCategoryIndices is not a function` error that left per-category `_INDEX.md` files stale.

### MCP-aware AGENTS.md generation

- `IndexGeneratorService.assembleRouterIndex(baseDir, allowedCategories, mcpEnabled)` — generated `AGENTS.md` now includes a "🔌 Runtime Enforcement via MCP" section above the router table. The block is **always present** so it remains correct in all four states (CLI-installed, manually-installed, partially-uninstalled, never-installed). The optional `mcpEnabled` parameter only controls a small status note (TIP vs NOTE) telling the user whether `.skillsrc` opts the project in.
- The block is phrased self-checkingly — "**If** `load_skills_for_files` is in your tool list, prefer those tools" — so the AI verifies MCP presence via its own tool list before assuming.
- `SyncService.applyIndices` reads `config.mcp?.enabled` and passes it through.
- **Single source of truth**: the MCP block lives ONLY in `AGENTS.md`. Per-agent rule files (Cursor `.mdc`, Copilot instructions, Claude `CLAUDE.md`, Antigravity/Windsurf/Trae/Kiro/Roo rules) continue to point at `AGENTS.md` as their first read, so the MCP message reaches the agent without duplication that could drift.

### `ags mcp status` mismatch detection

- `ags mcp status` now warns when `.skillsrc.mcp.enabled` is out of sync with the actual runtime-config presence:
  - **`enabled: false` + manual install detected** → suggests `ags mcp enable` (so `sync` keeps configs in step) OR `ags mcp uninstall --from project` (clean up the manual entry).
  - **`enabled: true` + no runtime config wired** → suggests `ags mcp install` OR `ags mcp disable`.
- This makes the consent flag (`.skillsrc`) and the actual runtime presence diagnose-able with one command, regardless of how the MCP got installed.

### Versions

- **CLI**: `2.1.3` → `2.2.0`
- **MCP**: new package — `0.1.0`
- **iOS**: `1.4.4` → `1.4.5` (keyword expansion: `ios-performance`, `ios-security`)
- **PHP**: `1.3.3` → `1.3.4` (keyword expansion: `php-security`)
- **React**: `1.3.4` → `1.3.5` (keyword expansion: `react-security`, `react-typescript`)
- **Swift**: `1.3.4` → `1.3.5` (keyword expansion: `swift-best-practices`)

## [2.1.3] - 2026-04-22

**Category**: Structured Frontmatter Migration & New Workflow Skills

### Added

- **Android Workflow Skills (4)**: `android-edge-to-edge` (inset patterns with RIGHT/WRONG code), `android-agp-upgrade` (6-step AGP 9 migration), `android-compose-migration` (10-step XML-to-Compose workflow), `android-navigation-3` (Nav2-to-Nav3 migration with 6 recipes). Inspired by Google's official [android/skills](https://github.com/android/skills).
- **Flutter Workflow Skills (1)**: `flutter-concurrency` (isolate decision matrix). Inspired by Flutter's official [flutter/skills](https://github.com/flutter/skills).
- **Evals for all 5 new skills**: 3 positive test cases + 5 negative (should-not-trigger) cases each.
- **Verification sections** added to `android-compose`, `android-architecture`, `android-state`, `flutter-bloc-state-management`, `flutter-testing` with runnable checklist items.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-04-11

**Category**: Token Economy & Custom Skill Indexing

### Added

- **Custom Skill Indexing**: Enhanced the `ags sync` logic to discover and index individual `.md` files as standalone skills alongside standard registry folders.
- **Standalone Skill Support**: Users can now add local skills directly to their `.cursor/skills/` or other agent folders without requiring a full registry structure.

### Changed

- **Token Economy (Caveman Mode)**: Applied the "Caveman" compression strategy to all 238 registry skills, reducing total token count by approximately 45%.
- **Skill Density**: Removed filler words and fluff from all `SKILL.md` body content while maintaining 100% technical and code accuracy.

### Fixed

- **CLI metadata sync**: Fixed an issue where `ags sync` failed to populate the hierarchical router table in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Linting**: Fixed unused `prefix` variable in `IndexGeneratorService.ts`.

### Versions

- **CLI**: v2.1.1 (Patch — maintain stable version)
- **Skills**: v2.2.0 (Minor — global Caveman token optimization)

## [2.1.1] - 2026-04-04

**Category**: Fix Hierarchical Index Sync

### Fixed

- **CLI metadata sync**: Fixed an issue where `ags sync` failed to populate the hierarchical router table in `AGENTS.md`. The `IndexGeneratorService` now uses an in-memory `RemoteMetadata` injection system to fetch `skills/metadata.json` directly from the registry without writing it to the user's disk.
- **Index Generation**: Added `withMetadata()` to `IndexGeneratorService` to allow injecting `file_routing`, `broad_globs`, and `base_language_skills` at runtime during a sync operation.

### Versions

- **CLI**: v2.1.1 (Patch — fix metadata injection during sync)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Hierarchical Skill Resolution (CLI)**: New architecture that replaces the flat AGENTS.md index (238 entries, ~300 lines) with a two-level hierarchy:
  - **Router table** (`AGENTS.md`, ~20 lines) — maps file extensions to per-category `_INDEX.md` files.
  - **Category indexes** (`_INDEX.md`) — compact trigger tables with **File Match** and **Keyword Match** sections, auto-generated from SKILL.md frontmatters.
  - Reduces scan cost from O(n) to O(1) — ~25 lines per lookup regardless of total skill count.
- **Three-Tier Trigger Model (CLI)**: `IndexGeneratorService` now classifies triggers into tiers:
  - **File Match**: Skills with specific path patterns (e.g., `**/page.tsx`) or the designated `base_language_skills`.
  - **Keyword Match**: Skills with only broad globs (e.g., `**/*.ts`) are automatically demoted to keyword-only activation.
  - Reduces `*.ts` file auto-matches from 27 skills to 6 (78% reduction).
- **`metadata.json` extensions**: Added `file_routing` (24 extension-to-category mappings), `broad_globs` (13 patterns to demote), and `base_language_skills` (19 category-to-base-skill mappings).
- **`IndexGeneratorService` new methods**: `generateCategoryIndex()`, `generateAllCategoryIndices()`, `assembleRouterIndex()`.
- **Description-based trigger extraction**: `parseSkill()` now extracts and classifies triggers from the description `(triggers: ...)` suffix when structured `metadata.triggers` is absent (covers 100% of current skills).
- **21 new unit tests**: 411 total (up from 409). Full coverage for hierarchical generation, tier classification, and router output.

### Changed

- **Angular skill merge**: Merged `angular-component-patterns` into `angular-components` (16 → 15 skills). Combined OnPush/Signals content + Standalone/Control Flow into one skill with 9 merged evals.
- **Tessl Quality Audit (237 skills)**: Achieved 100% compliance across all 237 skills:
  - 21 vague leading verbs replaced ("Manage" → "Configure", "Implement", "Validate", etc.).
  - 6 inline code blocks (>10 lines) extracted to `references/` files.
  - 4 missing "Use when" clauses added.
  - 2 missing trigger hints added.
  - 1 description trimmed to <100 words.
- **`SyncService.applyIndices()`**: Now generates `_INDEX.md` per category for all target agents and produces router-style `AGENTS.md`.
- **`generate-indices.ts`**: Now outputs per-category `_INDEX.md` files alongside `index.json`.
- **Documentation rewrite**: Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` (added ADR-003, ADR-004), `README.md` (restructured for readability and SEO), `cli/ARCHITECTURE.md` (added service details), `cli/README.md` (added output examples).

### Versions

- **CLI**: v2.1.0 (Minor — hierarchical resolution, three-tier triggers, new methods)
- **Root**: v2.1.0 (Minor — sync)
- **Angular Skills**: v1.4.0 (Minor — skill merge)
- **Common Skills**: v2.0.2 (Patch — description quality fixes)
- **All other categories**: Patch bumps (description quality fixes) — see metadata.json for individual versions.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-30

**Category**: Security Hardening & AI Learning Log System

### Added

- **🆕 `common/common-learning-log`**: New high-density skill for AI autonomous self-improvement. Defines a structured methodology for agents to capture mistakes, identify anti-patterns, and log better approaches to `AGENTS_LEARNING.md`. Integrated as a mandatory post-task retrospective loop.
- **🛡️ CI Injection Scanner**: Added `scripts/scan-injection.ts` and integrated it into the GitHub Actions CI pipeline. This scanner automatically flags any skill descriptions matching prompt injection patterns, preventing malicious instructions from entering the registry.
- **🚀 Enhanced Rate Limiting**: configured a custom `feedback` throttler profile in the NestJS backend, restricting the feedback endpoint to **3 requests per 60 seconds** while maintaining a global 10/min baseline.

### Changed

- **🛡️ `IndexGeneratorService` (CLI)**: Implemented `sanitizeDescription()` to strip instruction-hijack patterns (e.g., "ignore previous rules") from skill descriptions during index generation. Malicious patterns are replaced with `[REDACTED]` and logged to `stderr` with a `[SECURITY]` warning.
- **🛡️ `SkillSyncService` (CLI)**: Hardened `isPathSafe()` logic by explicitly using `path.sep` for boundary enforcement, successfully blocking sibling-directory traversal attacks (e.g., `/app/skills-secret`).
- **🛡️ `FeedbackService` (Backend)**: Implemented error masking for API responses. Internal GitHub API details are hidden from clients and replaced with a generic error message, while maintaining full diagnostic logs on the server.
- **🔄 `common/session-retrospective`**: Updated the retrospective protocol to include **Step 6: Update Learning Log**, ensuring agents record any correction loops from the current session.
- **📊 `metadata.json`**: Repaired `quality-engineering` metrics (5 skills, recalculated tokens) and added `quality-engineer` + `zephyr` keywords to `common/tdd` foundational rules.

### Versions

- **CLI**: v2.0.1 (Patch — security hardening & sanitization)
- **Common Skills**: v2.0.1 (Patch — new `common-learning-log`, retrospective update)
- **Quality Engineering**: v1.4.1 (Patch — added zephyr coverage analysis)
- **Root**: v2.0.1 (Patch — sync)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-25

**Category**: Community Skill Score Improvements & New Store Changelog Skill & QE/Security Skill Enhancements

### Added

- **🆕 `common/store-changelog`**: New skill for generating user-facing release notes for **Apple App Store** (≤ 4000 chars) and **Google Play Store** (≤ 500 chars). Includes a 5-step workflow (collect → triage → draft → compress → validate), per-store output format template, anti-patterns (`no chore bullets`, `no jargon`, `no character overrun`), commit-to-bullet mapping examples, and 4 evals. Triggers: `generate changelog`, `app store notes`, `play store release`, `what's new`, `release notes`.
- **📋 User Story Authoring Standards** (`quality-engineering-business-analysis`): Added §5 User Story Authoring Standards (story structure, atomic AC format, platform tags, toggle contracts, market isolation, scope fence, translation AC rules), §6 Anti-Patterns for story authoring, and §7 Validation Checklist (8-point self-check before marking a story ready). Added `references/user_story_template.md` with a full worked example and 3 new evals (IDs 4–6).
- **🛡️ Always-Apply Pattern** (`common/owasp`, `common/security-standards`): Hoisted the 3 most universal rules in each skill to a new `## Always-Apply Rules` block — applied on every code write, not just during dedicated security reviews. Remaining rules moved to `## Context-Specific Checklist` / `## Context-Specific Rules` with `Activate when:` prefaces.

### Changed

- **🏗️ `cli/src/constants/index.ts`**: Added `common-store-changelog` to `mobile` and `frontend` exclusion group lists. Added `common-system-design` to the `mobile` exclusion group.
- **🔢 Skill Scores** (community PR [#68](https://github.com/HoangNguyen0403/agent-skills-standard/pull/68) by [@rohan-tessl](https://github.com/rohan-tessl), commit `61c64ff`): Ran `tessl skill review` across all 234 skills — **average score lifted from ~82% to ~92%**. Top movers: `swift-error-handling` (0% → 89%), `common-observability` (60% → 94%), `common-best-practices` (61% → 89%), `nestjs-architecture` (81% → 100%). Key changes:
  - Replaced passive `"Standards for..."` descriptions with action-verb-led phrasing across all 234 skills.
  - Added missing `"Use when..."` clauses to all skills without them.
  - Added 1–2 inline executable code examples per skill (~150 skills), then extracted them to `references/` files for token economy.
  - Restructured flat bullet lists into numbered implementation workflows with validation steps (~150 skills).
  - Added anti-patterns sections where missing; linked related topics as proper relative paths.
  - Fixed `swift-error-handling` XML-like `<T,E>` tags in description that caused 0% validation score.
  - Added bold priority levels across Android skills.

### Versions

- **Common Skills**: v1.10.0 (Minor — new `common-store-changelog` skill, security Always-Apply pattern)
- **Quality Engineering**: v1.4.0 (Minor — User Story Authoring Standards + Validation Checklist)
- **All 234 framework skills**: Score-optimized via community PR #68 (patch-level description and content improvements)
- **CLI**: v2.0.0 (Major — constants update and framework bump)

## [1.10.4] - 2026-03-21

**Category**: CLI Fixes & Skill Registration Refactor

### Fixed

- **Skill Detection Registry**: Fixed an issue where the CLI failed to correctly exclude or detect skills because the `id` values in `SKILL_DETECTION_REGISTRY` did not match the actual folder names (missing framework prefixes).
- **Test Suite Alignment**: Synchronized the CLI test suite (`SkillService.spec.ts` and `ConfigService.spec.ts`) with the new prefixed skill ID format to ensure 100% test coverage and validation.

## [1.10.3] - 2026-03-21

- **Unified Skill Evals (Full Stack)**: Introduced `evals/evals.json` for PHP, Laravel, Next.js, and Angular categories (45+ new eval files).
- **Version Synchronisation (Web Frameworks)**: Incremented versions for core categories: PHP to `1.3.0`, Laravel to `1.3.0`, Next.js to `1.4.0`, and Angular to `1.3.0`.
- **Version Synchronisation (Backend)**: Incremented versions for core backend categories: NestJS updated to `1.4.0`, Golang to `1.3.0`, and Spring Boot to `1.3.0`.
- **Token Economy Mastery**: Refactored the heaviest skills (React, Next.js, Android, NestJS, Angular) to stay within optimized token budgets using the "Three-Level Loading System".
- **Trigger Optimization**: Significant update to `(triggers: ...)` descriptions for all frameworks to improve intent matching and reduce false negatives in IDE agents.
- **Metadata Synchronization**: Incremented skill category versions: Android/Java/Kotlin/iOS to `1.4.0`, React/TypeScript/Swift/Angular to `1.3.0`, and React Native to `1.4.0`.

- **Inline Triggers**: Validates the highly-optimized `(triggers: ...)` syntax in the description string instead of relying on legacy YAML arrays.
- **Skill Optimization**: Applied genuine "Progressive Disclosure" refactoring to the heaviest `SKILL.md` files (`database-postgresql`, `nextjs-pages-router`, `common-error-handling`, etc.) dropping maximum file sizes from ~900+ tokens to ~400 tokens by extracting code blocks into `references/`.
- **Skill Template**: Overhauled `skills/common/common-skill-creator/references/TEMPLATE.md` to enforce the new token-economy constraints (no YAML bloat, mandatory anti-patterns).

### Fixed

- **Custom Overrides Mapping**: Fixed a bug in `SkillSyncService` and `WorkflowSyncService` where `custom_overrides: ['skill-name']` in `.skillsrc` was failing to properly protect nested file paths.
- **Removed YAML Bloat**: Stripped all legacy `keywords:` and `files:` arrays across all 229 `SKILL.md` frontmatters.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-03-16

**Category**: Gemini CLI Standard Compliance & Refactoring

### Changed (All Skills)

- **🚀 Native Gemini CLI Compliance**: Migrated all 229 framework skills to strictly adhere to the official Gemini CLI `skill-creator` standard.
- **📁 Structural Renaming**: All skill subdirectories have been renamed to exactly match their canonical, hyphenated skill name (e.g., `skills/angular/architecture` → `skills/angular/angular-architecture`).
- **📝 Frontmatter Standardization**: Converted all `SKILL.md` YAML frontmatter `name:` fields to lowercase hyphen-case.
- **🔎 Trigger Flattening**: Extracted custom `metadata.triggers` arrays and seamlessly merged them into the single-line `description` string to ensure full native visibility by Gemini CLI without losing routing context.

### Fixed (CLI & Indexing)

- **🐛 Markdownlint Compliance**: Fixed missing whitespace on ATX headings, improper list spacing, and emphasis character (`_` vs `*`) violations inside `AGENTS.md` and the `IndexGeneratorService`.
- **📏 Description Length**: Bumped internal validation constraint for skill descriptions from 300 up to `1024` characters to align with Gemini's maximum limit.

## [1.9.3] - 2026-03-15

**Category**: Protocol Security & Refactoring Fixes

### Fixed (CLI)

- **⚡ `IndexGeneratorService` — Restored Protocol Header**: Reinstated the critical `[!IMPORTANT]` block at the top of the generated `AGENTS.md` to ensure agents always "Audit Before Write".
- **🔎 Framework Filtering**: Fixed a regression in `SyncService` where all skills were included regardless of `.skillsrc` config. The index now strictly filters based on the project's activated frameworks.
- **🐛 Frontmatter Parsing**: Fixed a fragile regex in the Markdown frontmatter parser to handle different line endings (`\r\n` vs `\n`).
- **🛡️ CLI Testing**: Rectified failing configuration and sync test suites by providing explicit mocks for `skills`.

### Changed (Skills — Common)

- **🛡️ `common/protocol-enforcement`**: Institutionalized the adversarial Red-Team verification skill by moving it from a hidden local directory to the global `skills/common` library.

### Changed (Skills — Flutter)

- **🖼️ `flutter/flutter-design-system`**: Enforced adherence to standard DLS widgets; explicitly banned the usage of generic widgets like `SizedBox` for spacing or hardcoded `Colors.xxx`, ensuring zero UI fragmentation.
- **🤖 `flutter/testing`**: Re-enforced the "Robot-First" testing pattern, mandating that screens and widgets utilize globally shared keys and explicitly defined Robot classes to isolate test logic from UI implementation details.

### Changed (Skills — NestJS)

- **📨 `nestjs/nestjs-bullmq`**: Upgraded Queue processor standards to prevent idle-polling storms and rate-limiting outages.
  - Required `drainDelay` and `stalledInterval` optimizations specifically for Upstash Redis.
  - Structured fail-open patterns for BaseProcessors and Throttlers.

### Versions

- **CLI**: v1.9.3 (Patch)
- **Common Skills**: v1.7.2 (Patch)
- **Flutter Skills**: v1.4.1 (Patch)
- **NestJS Skills**: v1.2.1 (Patch)

## [1.9.2] - 2026-03-08

**Category**: Trigger Rate Improvements — Stricter Pre-Flight Protocol & AGENTS.md Index Upgrade

### Changed (CLI)

- **⚡ `IndexGeneratorService` — Mandatory Action Table**: Replaced the passive "Reading This Index" section in the generated `AGENTS.md` index with a `[!CRITICAL]` blocking alert and a three-row trigger-type table. Each row explicitly states the **Required Action** (`Call view_file on the skill's SKILL.md`), making it structurally harder for agents to skip skill loading.
- **💡 Indirect Phrasing Hint**: Added a `[!TIP]` block in the index header with concrete intent-to-keyword examples ("make it faster" → `performance`, "broken query" → `database`, "login flow" → `auth`) so agents match by intent rather than exact wording.
- **🔒 `AgentBridgeService` — Strict Pre-Flight Protocol**: Updated the generated rule body (written to `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.github/instructions/*.md`, `.agent/rules/*.md`, etc.) to the new Strict Pre-Flight Protocol format with a `[!CRITICAL]` blocking notice and an explicit 4-step checklist including exact tool calls.
- **🎯 Frontmatter Style**: Standardized single-quote glob syntax (`globs: ['**/*']`) in generated Cursor and Copilot rule frontmatter.

### Changed (Skills — Common)

- **🔄 `common/session-retrospective`**: Added **Trigger Miss** as a first-class root cause category. New step 3 "Trigger Miss Check" requires agents to explicitly ask _"Was a relevant skill available but not loaded?"_ after every session. Added structured `trigger_miss` JSON output block so misses can be aggregated to measure recall over time.

### Changed (Skills — Database & Composite Rules)

- **🌐 `foundational_composite_rules` (metadata.json)**: Added two new foundational anchors:
  - **`common/mobile-ux-core`** auto-injects into all `screen`, `page`, `view`, `activity`, `fragment` skills (Flutter, iOS, Android, React Native).
  - **`common/system-design`** auto-injects into `architecture`, `migration`, `microservices`, `background-work`, `clean-architecture` skills.

### Versions

- **CLI**: v1.9.2 (Patch)
- **Common Skills**: v1.7.1 (Patch)
- **Database Skills**: v1.1.1 (Patch)

## [1.9.1] - 2026-03-05

**Category**: Intermittent Fetch Failure & Framework Detection Fix

### Fixed (CLI)

- **🌐 Fetch Reliability**: Replaced Node's native `fetch` with `cross-fetch` in `GithubService` to resolve `TypeError: fetch failed` errors during `ags sync` on environments with strict IPv6 or DNS buffering (Node 18+ Vite bundle issue).
- **🔎 Framework Detection Accuracy**: Fixed `ConfigService.reconcileDependencies()` to accurately skip auto-detection of base frameworks (like `React`) if their core dependencies (`react`, `react-dom`) are missing, even when sub-skill dependencies (like `jest` for `testing`) are present. This prevents NestJS projects from incorrectly inheriting React skills.

### Versions

- **CLI**: v1.9.1 (Patch)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-04

**Category**: Universal Trigger-Rate Optimization & Skill-Creator Enhancement

### Changed (Skills — All Categories)

- **🎯 Pushy Descriptions (228 skills)**: Applied explicit `"Use when…"` trigger clause to every skill description across all 21 categories. Previously passive descriptions (e.g., "Standards for WorkManager and Background Processing") now include concrete activation contexts (e.g., "Use when implementing background tasks, scheduled work, or long-running operations in Android."), making agents more reliably activate the correct skill from the description alone.
- **🧪 `common/skill-creator`**: Improved to cover test generation, regression catching, and trigger-rate measurement & optimization:
  - Added **Test, Measure & Iterate** section with a 5-step validation workflow targeting ≥80% trigger accuracy.
  - Added 6 new trigger keywords: `test skill`, `eval skill`, `trigger rate`, `optimize description`, `skill regression`, `improve skill`.
  - New `references/testing.md`: Documents `evals/evals.json` schema, should-trigger / should-not-trigger query design, "pushy" description optimization (before/after examples), and regression-catching protocol.
  - Updated `references/lifecycle.md` Phase 4: validation checklist now requires eval cases and ≥80% trigger-rate target.

### Fixed (CLI)

- **🔀 `AgentBridgeService` Newline Bug**: Fixed `.join('\\n')` → `.join('\n')` so all generated rule files (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.github/instructions/*.md`, `.agent/rules/*.md`, etc.) now contain real line breaks instead of literal `\n` sequences. The entire rule body was previously collapsed into a single unformatted line, making the Skill Activation Protocol nearly unparseable by agents.
- **📋 Skill Activation Protocol**: Updated the generated rule body content with an explicit 4-step ordered checklist replacing the passive "ALWAYS consult AGENTS.md" instruction, ensuring agents follow a deterministic skill-loading sequence.

### Versions

**Category**: Agent Detection Restoration & Rule Integrity

### Fixed (CLI)

- **🛡️ Agent Detection**: Restored the logic to only generate rule files if an agent is actually detected in the project (e.g., `.cursor`, `.clauderules`, etc.). This prevents polluting projects with unused configuration folders.
- **🧪 Test Coverage**: Re-introduced and verified unit tests for agent detection skips and hits.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-03-02

**Category**: Agent Bridge Dynamic Path Correction & Logic Optimization

### Fixed (CLI)

- **🔄 Dynamic Rule Links**: Fixed hardcoded `../skills/` links in generated agent rules. The self-learning protocol now uses a dynamically calculated relative path to the `/skills` folder, ensuring correct navigation for all agents (Cursor, Claude, Copilot, etc.).
- **🧹 Logic Optimization**: Removed redundant agent detection check in `AgentBridgeService` to improve performance and consistency.
- **🧪 Test Hardening**: Updated `AgentBridgeService.spec.ts` with specific assertions for dynamic pathing across different agent configurations.

### Versions

- **CLI**: v1.8.1 (Patch)

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-02

**Category**: Common Skills Gap Closure & CLI Smart Exclusions

### Added (Skills)

- **♿ `common/accessibility`**: New P1 skill — WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards for web UI agents: semantic HTML, ARIA usage rules, keyboard navigation, color contrast ratios, and CI testing gate (`axe-core`). Scoped to frontend file patterns (`*.tsx`, `*.jsx`, `*.html`, `*.vue`, `*.component.html`).
- **📡 `common/api-design`**: New P1 skill — REST API conventions covering HTTP verb semantics, status code correctness, URL design, versioning strategy, cursor-based pagination, and OpenAPI 3.1 contract requirements. Scoped to controller/router/handler file patterns.
- **🛡️ `common/error-handling`**: New P1 skill — Cross-cutting error design standards: HTTP error response envelope, error classification by layer, wrapping vs. replacement rules, boundary placement, and error code naming. Scoped to service/handler/controller backend file patterns.
- **📊 `common/observability`**: New P1 skill — Backend observability standards: structured JSON logging (required fields), OpenTelemetry distributed tracing (W3C `traceparent`), metric naming conventions, SLO definitions, and correlation ID propagation. Scoped to backend service file patterns.
- **🧠 `common/session-retrospective`**: New meta-skill — Self-learning protocol for AI agents. At the end of any multi-step task with user corrections, the agent analyzes the conversation to detect skill gaps, missing rules, or violated standards, then proposes targeted skill improvements to prevent repeat rework. Includes `references/methodology.md`.
- **🛠️ `common/skill-creator`**: New meta-skill — Standards for creating new high-density agent skills with optimal token economy. Includes `references/TEMPLATE.md` (scaffold), `references/lifecycle.md` (review → publish flow), and `references/resource-organization.md` (when and how to use `references/` sub-files).
- **📐 `common/system-design` references**: Added `references/distributed-systems.md` (CAP theorem, consistency models, event-driven patterns) and `references/resilience-patterns.md` (circuit breakers, bulkheads, idempotency) — keeping the primary SKILL.md lean while providing depth.

### Changed (Skills)

- **🔧 Trigger Hardening**: Added file-glob triggers to `common/best-practices`, `common/security-standards`, `common/performance-engineering`, and `common/tdd` — these foundational skills now fire automatically on source file edits, not just keyword matches.
- **⚡ `common/performance-engineering`**: Elevated from P1 to P0 — performance regressions have direct business impact equivalent to security issues.
- **✅ `common/tdd`**: Expanded with minimum coverage threshold (80%), AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) structure guidance, language-specific runner commands, and mock-vs-real dependency decision rules.
- **🌐 `AGENTS.md`**: Added conflict resolution protocol — when two skills conflict, apply the more specific skill (framework > language > common); same-specificity conflicts defer to `common/security-standards` for security and `common/best-practices` for design decisions.

### Fixed (Security)

- **🔐 `golang/security`**: Enforced Argon2id over bcrypt for password hashing — harmonized with `nestjs/security` for consistent polyglot security posture. Added explicit `RS256` / `HS256` JWT algorithm enforcement and `none` rejection.
- **🍪 `typescript/security`**: Fixed `NODE_ENV === 'prod'` (always `false` in production) → `NODE_ENV === 'production'` in secure cookie configuration, preventing cookies being transmitted over HTTP in production deployments.

### Changed (Framework Skills)

- **🧪 `flutter/testing`**: Major rewrite of testing skill and all references. Added `test-organization.md` (new), `widget-keys.md` (new), significantly expanded `robot-pattern.md`, `widget-testing.md`, `integration-testing.md`, and `mocking_standards.md` with up-to-date patterns.
- **🧪 `nestjs/testing`**: Added `improve-coverage.md` and `strict-typescript-testing.md` reference files. Updated `patterns.md` with additional test patterns.
- **⚛️ `react/state-management`**: Clarified skill boundary — `hooks` skill covers primitive API usage (`useMemo`, `useCallback`); this skill covers architectural state decisions (Context, Zustand, Redux). Added `useMemo` on context value guidance. Removed overlapping Anti-Patterns section.
- **🔐 `golang/security`**: Enforced Argon2id (time=1, memory=64MB, threads=4) over bcrypt. Added `RS256`/`HS256` JWT algorithm enforcement with `none` rejection for multi-service auth.
- **🍪 `typescript/security`**: Fixed `NODE_ENV === 'production'` cookie guard.

### Added (CLI)

- **📦 Framework-aware common skill exclusions**: `ags init` now auto-populates `common.exclude` in `.skillsrc` based on the detected framework type, eliminating irrelevant skills from agent context:
  - **Backend** (NestJS, Go, Spring Boot, Laravel): excludes `accessibility`, `mobile-animation`, `mobile-ux-core`
  - **Frontend** (React, Next.js, Angular): excludes `observability`, `mobile-animation`, `mobile-ux-core`
  - **Mobile** (Flutter, Android, iOS, React Native): excludes `accessibility`, `api-design`, `observability`
- **`getFrameworkType()` helper**: New exported function in `constants/` — classifies any framework ID into `'backend' | 'frontend' | 'mobile' | null`. Replaces inline nested ternary in `ConfigService`.
- **`FRONTEND_FRAMEWORKS`, `MOBILE_FRAMEWORKS` constants**: Explicit framework category arrays for React/Angular/Next.js and Flutter/Android/iOS/React Native respectively.
- **New tests**: `constants/__tests__/index.spec.ts` (5 tests for `getFrameworkType`); 9 new `ConfigService` tests covering exclusion correctness per framework type including edge cases (unknown framework, missing common metadata).
